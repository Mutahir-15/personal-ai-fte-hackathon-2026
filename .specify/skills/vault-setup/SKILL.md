# Skill: vault-setup

**Version**: 1.0.0

## 1. Purpose

This skill sets up the complete Obsidian vault folder structure and seeds all required markdown files for the Personal AI Employee (Bronze Tier). It is the foundational skill that creates the necessary directory and file hierarchy for all other agent operations. Its idempotency ensures it can be run safely at any time to verify or repair the vault structure.

## 2. Inputs

- `vault_root_path`: The absolute path to the root directory where the "AI_Employee_Vault" will be created (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\Documents`). Provided by the user.

## 3. Outputs

- A complete directory structure for the AI Employee vault at `{vault_root_path}\AI_Employee_Vault`.
- Three seeded markdown files (`Dashboard.md`, `Company_Handbook.md`, `Business_Goals.md`) within the vault.

## 4. Pre-conditions

- The user-provided `vault_root_path` must be a valid and accessible directory path on the Windows 10 file system.
- The Gemini CLI must have permissions to create directories and write files within the `vault_root_path`.

## 5. Step-by-Step Execution Instructions

**Objective**: Create the `AI_Employee_Vault` with its required subdirectories and seed files.

**Path Variable**:
- Let `VAULT_PATH` = `vault_root_path` + `\AI_Employee_Vault`

**Execution Flow**:

1.  **Check and Create Vault Root**:
    - Verify if the directory `VAULT_PATH` exists.
    - If it does not exist, create it.
    - If it exists, proceed without error.

2.  **Create Subdirectories**:
    - For each folder name in the list `["Needs_Action", "Plans", "Done", "Pending_Approval", "Approved", "Rejected", "Logs", "Accounting", "Briefings"]`:
        - Construct the full path: `SUBDIR_PATH` = `VAULT_PATH` + `` + `folder_name`.
        - Verify if the directory `SUBDIR_PATH` exists.
        - If it does not exist, create it.
        - If it exists, proceed without error.

3.  **Create and Seed `Dashboard.md`**:
    - Define `FILE_PATH` = `VAULT_PATH` + `\Dashboard.md`.
    - Verify if the file `FILE_PATH` exists.
    - If it does not exist, create the file and write the content from the `Dashboard.md Template` (see Section 6).

4.  **Create and Seed `Company_Handbook.md`**:
    - Define `FILE_PATH` = `VAULT_PATH` + `\Company_Handbook.md`.
    - Verify if the file `FILE_PATH` exists.
    - If it does not exist, create the file and write the content from the `Company_Handbook.md Template` (see Section 6).

5.  **Create and Seed `Business_Goals.md`**:
    - Define `FILE_PATH` = `VAULT_PATH` + `\Business_Goals.md`.
    - Verify if the file `FILE_PATH` exists.
    - If it does not exist, create the file and write the content from the `Business_Goals.md Template` (see Section 6).

## 1. Mission
To automate repetitive tasks, manage digital communications, and provide actionable insights to drive business efficiency, all while operating under strict human-in-the-loop oversight.

## 2. Rules of Engagement

### 2.1. Core Principles
1.  **Local-First:** All sensitive data remains on the local machine unless explicit approval is granted for cloud synchronization.
2.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** The agent will NEVER execute sensitive or irreversible actions without direct human approval.
3.  **Transparency:** Every action taken by the agent is logged and auditable.

### 2.2. Sensitive Actions Requiring Approval
The following actions must be placed in the `/Pending_Approval/` directory for manual review:
- Any financial transaction (payments, transfers).
- Sending emails to new, un-approved contacts.
- Deleting files or records permanently.
- Publishing content to public social media platforms.

### 2.3. Communication Style
- **Tone:** Professional, concise, and direct.
- **Disclosure:** AI involvement will be disclosed in all external outbound communications, using the standard footer: "This message was drafted and sent with the assistance of a personal AI agent."

## 3. Operational Procedures
- **Incoming Work:** All new items detected by watchers are placed in `/Needs_Action/`.
- **Planning:** Plans generated by the AI are stored in `/Plans/`.
- **Completed Work:** Finished tasks are archived in `/Done/`.

## 7. Post-conditions / Verification

To verify successful execution, check the following conditions:
1.  The `VAULT_PATH` directory exists.
2.  All nine required subdirectories (`Needs_Action`, `Plans`, etc.) exist directly inside `VAULT_PATH`.
3.  The three seed markdown files (`Dashboard.md`, `Company_Handbook.md`, `Business_Goals.md`) exist directly inside `VAULT_PATH`.
4.  The contents of the three seed files match their respective templates.

## 8. Error Handling

- **Invalid `vault_root_path`**: If the provided root path is invalid or inaccessible, report an error to the user and halt execution. State: "Error: The provided path '{vault_root_path}' is not a valid directory or is inaccessible. Please provide a valid path."
- **Directory Exists**: If a directory to be created already exists, do nothing and proceed. This ensures idempotency.
- **File Exists**: If a seed file to be created already exists, do nothing and proceed. This ensures idempotency and prevents overwriting user modifications.
- **Permission Denied**: If a file or directory creation fails due to permissions, report an error and halt. State: "Error: Permission denied. Cannot create files or directories in '{VAULT_PATH}'. Please check permissions."

## 9. Success Criteria

- **PASS**: All directories and seed files listed in the "Required Vault Structure" exist at the correct paths and are not empty.
- **FAIL**: Any required directory or file is missing after execution.
