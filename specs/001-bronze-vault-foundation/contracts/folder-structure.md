# Folder Structure Contract: Bronze Vault Foundation

The system MUST maintain the following directory structure within the `AI_Employee_Vault` root.

## 1. /Needs_Action/
Input directory for the filesystem watcher.
- **Usage**: Dropping files here triggers the AI to analyze and move them to `/Plans/` or create a task.
- **Pattern**: `any_filename.ext` → `any_filename.md` (metadata wrapper)

## 2. /Plans/
Storage for proposed implementation plans and strategies.
- **Usage**: Gemini writes `plan.md` files here for complex tasks.
- **Pattern**: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.plan.md`

## 3. /Done/
Archive for completed tasks and processed inputs.
- **Usage**: Once an action is finalized, the input and plan move here.
- **Pattern**: Subfolders by year/month: `Done/2026/02/`

## 4. /Pending_Approval/
Queue for sensitive actions requiring human review.
- **Usage**: The AI drops a summary of the proposed action here.
- **Pattern**: `pending-action-ID.md`

## 5. /Approved/
Trigger for approved actions.
- **Usage**: Human moves a file from `/Pending_Approval/` to `/Approved/` to authorize execution.
- **Pattern**: `pending-action-ID.md` (moved from `/Pending_Approval/`)

## 6. /Rejected/
Archive for human-rejected actions.
- **Usage**: Human moves a file from `/Pending_Approval/` to `/Rejected/` to cancel execution.
- **Pattern**: `pending-action-ID.md` (moved from `/Pending_Approval/`)

## 7. /Logs/
Audit trail in JSON format.
- **Usage**: Every agent action is logged.
- **Pattern**: `YYYY-MM-DD.json`

## 8. /Accounting/
Financial and transaction logs (placeholders for Bronze).
- **Usage**: Logging any financial metadata.
- **Pattern**: `transactions-YYYY-MM.json`

## 9. /Briefings/
Output for weekly/daily summaries.
- **Usage**: Summaries generated by the AI for the CEO.
- **Pattern**: `YYYY-MM-DD-briefing.md`

## 10. /.watcher_state/ (Hidden/Internal)
State tracking for watchers and processors.
- **Usage**: Internal JSON state to prevent double-processing and manage locks.
- **Pattern**: `processed_files.json`, `current_session.json`
